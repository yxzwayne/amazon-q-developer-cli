# Knowledge Management

The /knowledge command provides persistent knowledge base functionality for Amazon Q CLI, allowing you to store, search, and manage contextual information that persists across chat sessions.

> Note: This is a beta feature that must be enabled before use.

## Getting Started

Enable the Knowledge Feature

The knowledge feature is experimental and disabled by default. Enable it with:

`q settings chat.enableKnowledge true`

## Basic Usage

Once enabled, you can use `/knowledge` commands within your chat session:

`/knowledge add myproject /path/to/project`
`/knowledge show`

## Commands

#### `/knowledge show`

Display all entries in your knowledge base with detailed information including creation dates, item counts, and persistence status.

#### `/knowledge add <name> <path> [--include pattern] [--exclude pattern] [--index-type Fast|Best]`

Add files or directories to your knowledge base. The system will recursively index all supported files in directories.

`/knowledge add "project-docs" /path/to/documentation`
`/knowledge add "config-files" /path/to/config.json`
`/knowledge add "fast-search" /path/to/logs --index-type Fast`
`/knowledge add "semantic-search" /path/to/docs --index-type Best`

**Index Types**

Choose the indexing approach that best fits your needs:

- **`--index-type Fast`** (Lexical - BM25): 
  - ✅ **Lightning-fast indexing** - processes files quickly
  - ✅ **Instant search** - keyword-based search with immediate results
  - ✅ **Low resource usage** - minimal CPU and memory requirements
  - ✅ **Perfect for logs, configs, and large codebases**
  - ❌ Less intelligent - requires exact keyword matches

- **`--index-type Best`** (Semantic - all-MiniLM-L6-v2):
  - ✅ **Intelligent search** - understands context and meaning
  - ✅ **Natural language queries** - search with full sentences
  - ✅ **Finds related concepts** - even without exact keyword matches
  - ✅ **Perfect for documentation, research, and complex content**
  - ❌ Slower indexing - requires AI model processing
  - ❌ Higher resource usage - more CPU and memory intensive

**When to Use Each Type:**

| Use Case | Recommended Type | Why |
|----------|------------------|-----|
| Log files, error messages | `Fast` | Quick keyword searches, large volumes |
| Configuration files | `Fast` | Exact parameter/value lookups |
| Large codebases | `Fast` | Fast symbol and function searches |
| Documentation | `Best` | Natural language understanding |
| Research papers | `Best` | Concept-based searching |
| Mixed content | `Best` | Better overall search experience |

**Default Behavior:**

If you don't specify `--index-type`, the system uses your configured default:

```bash
# Set your preferred default
q settings knowledge.indexType Fast   # or Best

# This will use your default setting
/knowledge add "my-project" /path/to/project
```

**Default Pattern Behavior**

When you don't specify `--include` or `--exclude` patterns, the system uses your configured default patterns:

- If no patterns are specified and no defaults are configured, all supported files are indexed
- Default include patterns apply when no `--include` is specified
- Default exclude patterns apply when no `--exclude` is specified
- Explicit patterns always override defaults

Example with defaults configured:
```bash
q settings knowledge.defaultIncludePatterns '["**/*.rs", "**/*.py"]'
q settings knowledge.defaultExcludePatterns '["target/**", "__pycache__/**"]'

# This will use the default patterns
/knowledge add "my-project" /path/to/project

# This will override defaults with explicit patterns
/knowledge add "docs-only" /path/to/project --include "**/*.md"
```

**New: Pattern Filtering**

You can now control which files are indexed using include and exclude patterns:

`/knowledge add "rust-code" /path/to/project --include "*.rs" --exclude "target/**"`
`/knowledge add "docs" /path/to/project --include "**/*.md" --include "**/*.txt" --exclude "node_modules/**"`

Pattern examples:
- `*.rs` - All Rust files in all directories recursively (equivalent to `**/*.rs`)
- `**/*.py` - All Python files recursively
- `target/**` - Everything in target directory
- `node_modules/**` - Everything in node_modules directory

Supported file types (expanded):

- Text files: .txt, .log, .rtf, .tex, .rst
- Markdown: .md, .markdown, .mdx (now supported!)
- JSON: .json (now treated as text for better searchability)
- Configuration: .ini, .conf, .cfg, .properties, .env
- Data files: .csv, .tsv
- Web formats: .svg (text-based)
- Code files: .rs, .py, .js, .jsx, .ts, .tsx, .java, .c, .cpp, .h, .hpp, .go, .rb, .php, .swift, .kt, .kts, .cs, .sh, .bash, .zsh, .html, .htm, .xml, .css, .scss, .sass, .less, .sql, .yaml, .yml, .toml
- Special files: Dockerfile, Makefile, LICENSE, CHANGELOG, README (files without extensions)

> Important: Unsupported files are indexed without text content extraction.

#### `/knowledge remove <identifier>`

Remove entries from your knowledge base. You can remove by name, path, or context ID.

`/knowledge remove "project-docs"` # Remove by name
`/knowledge remove /path/to/old/project` # Remove by path

#### `/knowledge update <path>`

Update an existing knowledge base entry with new content from the specified path. The original include/exclude patterns are preserved during updates.

`/knowledge update /path/to/updated/project`

#### `/knowledge clear`

Remove all entries from your knowledge base. This action requires confirmation and cannot be undone.

You'll be prompted to confirm:

> ⚠️ This will remove ALL knowledge base entries. Are you sure? (y/N):

#### `/knowledge status`

View the status of background indexing operations, including progress and queue information.

#### `/knowledge cancel [operation_id]`

Cancel background operations. You can cancel a specific operation by ID or all operations if no ID is provided.

`/knowledge cancel abc12345 # Cancel specific operation`
`/knowledge cancel all # Cancel all operations`

## Configuration

Configure knowledge base behavior:

`q settings knowledge.maxFiles 10000` # Maximum files per knowledge base
`q settings knowledge.chunkSize 1024` # Text chunk size for processing
`q settings knowledge.chunkOverlap 256` # Overlap between chunks
`q settings knowledge.indexType Fast` # Default index type (Fast or Best)
`q settings knowledge.defaultIncludePatterns '["**/*.rs", "**/*.md"]'` # Default include patterns
`q settings knowledge.defaultExcludePatterns '["target/**", "node_modules/**"]'` # Default exclude patterns

## How It Works

#### Indexing Process

When you add content to the knowledge base:

1. **Pattern Filtering**: Files are filtered based on include/exclude patterns (if specified)
2. **File Discovery**: The system recursively scans directories for supported file types
3. **Content Extraction**: Text content is extracted from each supported file
4. **Chunking**: Large files are split into smaller, searchable chunks
5. **Background Processing**: Indexing happens asynchronously in the background
6. **Semantic Embedding**: Content is processed for semantic search capabilities

#### Search Capabilities

The knowledge base uses semantic search, which means:

- You can search using natural language queries
- Results are ranked by relevance, not just keyword matching
- Related concepts are found even if exact words don't match

#### Persistence

- Persistent contexts: Survive across chat sessions and CLI restarts
- Context persistence is determined automatically based on usage patterns
- Include/exclude patterns are stored with each context and reused during updates

#### Best Practices

Organizing Your Knowledge Base

- Use descriptive names when adding contexts: "api-documentation" instead of "docs"
- Group related files in directories before adding them
- Use include/exclude patterns to focus on relevant files
- Regularly review and update outdated contexts

#### Effective Searching

- Use natural language queries: "how to handle authentication errors using the knowledge tool"
- Be specific about what you're looking for: "database connection configuration"
- Try different phrasings if initial searches don't return expected results
- Prompt Q to use the tool with prompts like "find database connection configuration using your knowledge bases" or "using your knowledge tools can you find how to replace your laptop"

#### Managing Large Projects

- Add project directories rather than individual files when possible
- Use include/exclude patterns to avoid indexing build artifacts: `--exclude "target/**" --exclude "node_modules/**"`
- Use /knowledge status to monitor indexing progress for large directories
- Consider breaking very large projects into logical sub-directories

#### Pattern Filtering Best Practices

- **Be specific**: Use precise patterns to avoid over-inclusion
- **Exclude build artifacts**: Always exclude directories like `target/**`, `node_modules/**`, `.git/**`
- **Include relevant extensions**: Focus on file types you actually need to search
- **Test patterns**: Verify patterns match expected files before large indexing operations

## Limitations

#### File Type Support

- Binary files are ignored during indexing
- Very large files may be chunked, potentially splitting related content
- Some specialized file formats may not extract content optimally

#### Performance Considerations

- Large directories may take significant time to index
- Background operations are limited by concurrent processing limits
- Search performance may vary based on knowledge base size and embedding engine
- Pattern filtering happens during file walking, improving performance for large directories

#### Storage and Persistence

- No explicit storage size limits, but practical limits apply
- No automatic cleanup of old or unused contexts
- Clear operations are irreversible with no backup functionality

## Troubleshooting

#### Files Not Being Indexed

If your files aren't appearing in search results:

1. **Check patterns**: Ensure your include patterns match the files you want
2. **Verify exclude patterns**: Make sure exclude patterns aren't filtering out desired files
3. **Check file types**: Ensure your files have supported extensions
4. **Monitor status**: Use /knowledge status to check if indexing is still in progress
5. **Verify paths**: Ensure the paths you added actually exist and are accessible
6. **Check for errors**: Look for error messages in the CLI output

#### Search Not Finding Expected Results

If searches aren't returning expected results:

1. **Wait for indexing**: Use /knowledge status to ensure indexing is complete
2. **Try different queries**: Use various phrasings and keywords
3. **Verify content**: Use /knowledge show to confirm your content was added
4. **Check file types**: Unsupported file types won't have searchable content

#### Performance Issues

If operations are slow:

1. **Check queue status**: Use /knowledge status to see operation queue
2. **Cancel if needed**: Use /knowledge cancel to stop problematic operations
3. **Add smaller chunks**: Consider adding subdirectories instead of entire large projects
4. **Use better patterns**: Exclude unnecessary files with exclude patterns
5. **Adjust settings**: Consider lowering maxFiles or chunkSize for better performance

#### Pattern Issues

If patterns aren't working as expected:

1. **Test patterns**: Use simple patterns first, then add complexity
2. **Check syntax**: Ensure glob patterns use correct syntax (`**` for recursive, `*` for single level)
3. **Verify paths**: Make sure patterns match actual file paths in your project
4. **Use absolute patterns**: Consider using full paths in patterns for precision
